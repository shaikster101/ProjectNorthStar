# Project North Star
Project North Star is an open sourse project by Leap Motion, which levrages wide FoV and hand tracking for a more immersive and seamless AR experience.

## Stage 1: Parts

## Stage 2: Building 
### Lens:
The lens can be bought from [Smart Prototyping](https://www.smart-prototyping.com/Project-North-Star-Lens) or can by 3D printed using clear resin and then polished. 

**How to Polish**
1. Start at 400 Grit Sandpaper and move up in 300 level increments until lens is clear. **Spend at least 10 minutes on each level**
1. Use Novus plastic polish solutions to get make the lens smooth 3 -> 2 -> 1. **Spend at atleast 15 mins with each solution and use copious amounts of the solution. 

**Sand under running water**

### 3D Printed Parts:
The parts for the frame of the headset were 3D printed with CPE filament on Ultimaker 3 printers. 

**Important Settigns** 
Infill: 90%
Print Speed: Fast 

## Assembly: 

## Finished Product: 

# Stage 3: Calibration 
# Stage 4: TBD


## **The project is under constant imporvement with plans to add more functonality and test cases**
